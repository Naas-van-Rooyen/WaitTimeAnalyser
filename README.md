# WaitTimeAnalyser
Have you ever commuted a long way to a store, bank, etc. just to be met by an even longer queue? Then this program is for you! 
This program will predict the time that you will spend is those pesky queues, so you can decide if it is worth going at this very moment; taking the surprise out of surprisingly long queues!
The program will analyse and output the wait time based on the number of people currently in the queue and give you the option to face the queue or wait a while.
